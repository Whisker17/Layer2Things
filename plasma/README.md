# Plasma

This repo is a introduction and note about Plasma 

> Plasma uses **a combination of smart contracts and cryptographic verification**. Together, these enable fast and cheap transactions by offloading these transactions from the main Ethereum blockchain into a **"side" chain** (sometimes referred as child or plasma chains). These side chains periodically report back to the main chain and use it to settle any disputes (almost like a higher court).
